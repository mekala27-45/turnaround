"""Exact changepoint detection by PELT (Killick, Fearnhead and Eckley, 2012), ported from cityflow.

Chapter 2 asks when each carrier's schedule padding moved and stayed moved. That is a change in
mean, found by partitioning the series so that the total within segment cost plus a penalty per
segment is minimised. Optimal partitioning solves that exactly in O(n squared); PELT drops a
candidate start for good once its best cost plus the cost of reaching the current point is already
worse than the optimum there, which with the L2 cost changes nothing about the answer: the
segmentation is still the exact minimiser, which the tests check against brute force.

ruptures is not a dependency on purpose: the algorithm is forty lines, and a changepoint date that
appears in a published chapter should come from code that can be read in one sitting.
